# Mirror-clock-Problem
This program takes random type of input. But It'll give the correct answer iff the input is a valid time of an analog mirror clock. The clock does not have written digits. Time is measured by only notations. Now if the clock is displayed in mirror then this program will find out what the correct time is.
